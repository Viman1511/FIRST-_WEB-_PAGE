    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood";>EARLY LIFE </h1>
   <i> <p><strong>Eich grew up in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto,[2] and he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University,[2] and he received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[2] Eich is Roman Catholic.[1]</strong>
 <br>He began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating system and network code.[3] He then worked for three years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code.[citation needed]</br> </i> </p>

<h2> CAREER</h2>
<h2 style="background-color:mediumturquoise";> Scape </h2>
<i>Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser",[4] but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule,[4][5] and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and finally in a joint announcement with Sun Microsystem it was named JavaScript in December.[6] Simultaneously, he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape Navigator browser at Netscape Communications. When Mozilla inherited the Netscape base code in 1998, it included this engine, which was written in the C programming language.[7] It was then changed in JavaScript 1.5 to comply with the ECMA-262 standard.[citation needed] Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.[7]</i>
<h2 style="background-color:mediumturquoise";> Mozilla </h2>
<p> <i> <b>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others, creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect.[8] AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.</b>[9]
    <br>In August 2005, after serving as a lead technologist and as a member of the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation,</br> Eich became chief technical officer (CTO) of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm.[9] Eich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed on the ownership of it to Dave Mandolin in 2011.[7]</i></p>

<h2 style="background-color:lightsalmon";> Brave Software</h2>
<i>Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors.[34] In January 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source, Chromium-based Brave web browser,[35] which blocks ads and trackers.[36][37]
    At Brave Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017, and raised $35 million.[38]
    In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Eich ardently denied the effectiveness of face masks and lockdowns in combating the transmission of COVID-19 and stated that United States' top immunologist Anthony Fauci “lies a lot,” sparking calls for his removal from Brave on social media.[</i>
